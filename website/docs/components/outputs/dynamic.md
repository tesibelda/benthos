A special broker type where the outputs are identified by unique labels and can
be created, changed and removed during runtime via a REST API.

```yml
# Config fields, showing default values
output:
  label: ""
  dynamic:
    outputs: {}
    prefix: ""
```

The broker pattern used is always `fan_out`, meaning each message will
be delivered to each dynamic output.

To GET a JSON map of output identifiers with their current uptimes use the
'/outputs' endpoint.

To perform CRUD actions on the outputs themselves use POST, DELETE, and GET
methods on the `/outputs/{output_id}` endpoint. When using POST the
body of the request should be a YAML configuration for the output, if the output
already exists it will be changed.

## Fields

### `outputs`

A map of outputs to statically create.


Type: `object`  
Default: `{}`  

### `prefix`

A path prefix for HTTP endpoints that are registered.


Type: `string`  
Default: `""`
